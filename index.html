                            over the world. Through the Internet, people can share
                            information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet
                            connection. It was created in the United States in the 1970s,
                            but did not become visible to the general public until the 1990s.

                                regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.

                                The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for distributed,
                                collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate
                                data on the World Wide Web.
                            </li>


                            <li><b>Utility: </b>
                                HTTP was invented alongside HTML to create the first interactive, text-based
                                web browser: the original World Wide Web. Today, the protocol remains one of
                                the primary means of using the Internet. </li>



                            <li><b>Characteristics: </b>
                                Http is the request response protocol that allows web servers and browsers to exchange
                                data over the web,
                                uses the reliable TCP connections by default on TCP port 80 and is stateless means each
                                request is
                                considered as the new request. In other words, server doesn't recognize the user by
                                default. </li>

                        across the network to the web application server. The request reaches
                        the application for processing.

                            TTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a standard that defines how
                            to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications
                            can exchange data.

                        <li><b>Utility:</b> </br>
                            TCP is used for organizing data in a way that ensures the secure
                            transmission between the server and client. It guarantees the integrity
                            of data sent over the network, regardless of the amount. For this reason,
                            it is used to transmit data from other higher-level protocols that
                            require all transmitted data to arrive.

                            IP address stands for “Internet Protocol address.” The Internet Protocol is a set of rules
                            for communication over the internet, such as sending mail, streaming video, or connecting
                            to a website. An IP address identifies a network or device on the internet.

                        <li><b>Utility:</b> </br>
                            The purpose of an IP address is to handle the connection between devices that send and
                            receive information across a network. </li>

                        <li><b>IP Adress</b> </br>
                            The Internet and your network are linked together with Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
                            There are two kinds of IP addresses: static and dynamic.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Routing:</b> </br>
                            Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across
                            multiple networks. Broadly, routing is performed in many types of networks, including
                            circuit-switched networks, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), and
                            computer networks, such as the Internet. </li>

                            multiple clients connect to a server. The clients require services, and the server
                            provides required services. On the other hand, in a peer to peer network, there
                            are no specific clients or servers.

                    MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types tell browsers how to handle specific extensions.
                    MIME types
                    are often used to handle new technologies as they appear. When WAP technology first appeared, no one
                    had these
                    extensions set up on their server.

                                the development effort is iterative, as soon as a development effort ends there starts
                                another.

                                The prototyping model is a systems development method in which a prototype is built,
                                tested and then reworked as necessary until an acceptable outcome is achieved from
                                which the complete system or product can be developed.

                                        Scrum is characterised by cycles or stages of development, known as sprints, and

                                        This Product Goal is a larger value objective, in which sprints bring the scrum

                        An entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a representation of data within a domain. It consists of
                        entities as well as relationships between entities. An entity can be a tangible, physical object
                        such as a school or student, or a concept such as a reply or a transaction.

                        Integrity Constraints are the protocols that a table's data columns must follow. These are used

                        restrict the types of information that can be entered into a table. This means that the data in
                        the
                        database is accurate and reliable. You may apply integrity Constraints at the column or table

                            <li>Weakly Typed Languages: Weak typing is where we do not indicate the type of a variable
                                when declaring it.
                                The real difference is that we can assign, for example, an integer value to a variable
                                that previously held a string.</li>

                                    <li>Insecurity: there is a possibility that an attacker discovers a vulnerability
                                        where we expect a variable of
                                        a certain type but another is received</li>
                                    <li>You have to cast many times. Sometimes, we will have to force cast the variables
                                        so that they behave as we
                                        want and do not generate errors like the ones mentioned above.</li>

                            <li>Strongly Typed Languages: This is where we indicate the data type when declaring the
                                variable. This type can never be
                                changed. And we cannot operate between different types.</li>

                    <li>What is the difference between static and dynamic typing?</li>
                    A dynamic language (Lisp, Perl, Python, Ruby) is designed to optimize programmer efficiency, so you
                    can implement
                    functionality with less code. A static language (C, C++, etc) is designed to optimize hardware
                    efficiency, so that
                    the code you write executes as quickly as possible.
                    <li>What is the timetomarket of a language?</li>
                    It is the time that passes from when a language is released until an update arrives to replace it.
                    <li>What is operator overloading?</li>
                    It is one of the mechanisms that allows us to extend the capabilities of object-oriented programming
                    languages.
                    <li>What is string interpolation?</li>
                    String interpolation is a technique that enables you to insert expression values into literal
                    strings. It is also known
                    as variable substitution, variable interpolation, or variable expansion. It is a process of
                    evaluating string literals
                    containing one or more placeholders that get replaced by corresponding values.
