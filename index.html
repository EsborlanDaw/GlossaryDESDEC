                                A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how
                                data is transmitted between different devices in the same network.
                                Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other,
                                regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.

                                The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for distributed,
                                collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate 
                                data on the World Wide Web.
                            </li>
                            <br>

                            <li><b>Utility: </b>
                                HTTP was invented alongside HTML to create the first interactive, text-based 
                                web browser: the original World Wide Web. Today, the protocol remains one of 
                                the primary means of using the Internet. </li>

                            <li><b>Characteristics: </b>
                                Http is the request response protocol that allows web servers and browsers to exchange data over the web,
                                uses the reliable TCP connections by default on TCP port 80 and is stateless means each request is 
                                considered as the new request. In other words, server doesn't recognize the user by default. </li>
